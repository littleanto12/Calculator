# Calculator
This is a simple calculator application built using Java. It currently supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. As the project progresses, graphical components will be added using Java's graphical libraries (such as Swing or JavaFX). This project is for educational purposes and will serve as a learning experience for building a graphical user interface (GUI) in Java.

## Features
Basic arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division)
Future updates will include a graphical interface (Java Swing/JavaFX)
User-friendly design

## Usage

After launching the application, enter numbers and select the desired operation. The result will be displayed instantly. Future versions will feature a graphical interface where users can interact with buttons and a display for results.
